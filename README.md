# AjaxHub
This purpose of this project is to provide a setup, where it's possible to develop ajax calls in a fashion similar to xajax (php).

While php certainly is not the way to do things clean for the majority of the time, xajax definitely turned doing ajax related development not only into a breeze but helped reducing weaving code.

I am trying to do the same thing here, providing a straight forward way to call your controller actions from javascript without the necessity to switch between razor syntax and javascript all the time.
